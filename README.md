# Sales-Performance-Dashboard

ðŸš€ **Sales Performance Dashboard** -** Power BI** ðŸ“Š

I recently created this Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI, which provides key insights into sales, profit, quantity, and returns. The dashboard includes:

âœ… **Total Sales & Profit** - â‚¹2.30M in sales and â‚¹286K in profit.
âœ… **Sales Breakdown** - Analysis by category, segment, and sub-category.
âœ… **Monthly Trends** - Sales and profit trends over the year.
âœ… **Geographical Insights** - State-wise profit distribution.
âœ… **Operational Metrics** - Average order-to-shipment days (3.96) and returns (301).

 #key Learnings from this Project:
 
ðŸ”¹ Data modeling and DAX calculations for key metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Creating interactive visualizations using Power BI.

ðŸ”¹ Implementing filters and slicers for better data exploration.

ðŸ”¹ Enhancing dashboard design & usability for better decision-making.
